    <h1 style="text-align: center">Best Color Combinations for Men's Clothing </h1>
    <p class="p_blog">
        I know you're saying that color theory is interesting and all but when am I going to learn how to use it in my style? Well reader, the answer is right now.
         Here are the best color combinations you can use in men's color matching. And by “best,” we mean classic combos you can't go wrong with. 
         You can always experiment on your own, of course.<br></p>

    <h6>Navy and White <br></h6>
    <p class="p_blog">
        Navy and white is men's color matching at its finest. The contrast between navy and white is super pronounced,
         giving both colors space to pop. More so, it is a classic combo, invoking things like sailing style.

        Style this look by pairing white jeans with a dark denim shirt or navy button down. The reverse of navy chinos
        and a crisp white oxford is a timeless look as well.<br></p>
                   
        <h6>Grey and Black <br></h6>
                    <p class="p_blog">
                        Grey and black is an (almost) criminally underused color combination. The subtle variation from grey to black
                        creates contrast while at the same time being muted. The tint in darker greys is reflected in whatever piece of black
                        clothing you are wearing. Ultimately, you capitalize on both the contrast and the complementary nature of the colors.

                        Wear this look with a pair of heather grey chinos and a black t-shirt or reverse it with a dark grey polo 
                        shirt and some black jeans.
                        <br></p>

                <h6> Green and Khaki</h6>
                  <p class="p_blog"> 

                    Military wear is a heavyweight for influence in menswear. It's obvious then that the military combo of 
                    green and khaki is one of the best color combinations a man can rock (i.e camouflage). Furthermore,
                     the color match of green and khaki just gives off woodland vibes. So maybe you're more into tents than 
                     you are into tanks. That works, too<br>
                  </p>

                  <h6>Black and White</h6>
                  <p class="p_blog"> 

                    The all-time classic. You literally can not go wrong with pairing black and white. No one will
                     tell you it's a weird color combination. In fact, the high contrast gives a clean and elegant
                      look. The one addendum is that black and white can be somewhat formal, depending on how you wear 
                      it. That's why Black-Tie and White-Tie events are the dressiest.<br>
                  </p>

                  <h6>Brown and Burgundy</h6>
                  <p class="p_blog"> 

                    Give off scholarly vibes. Not the nerdy professor, but the well-read tenured man who's lived in
                     Morocco and sips on Johnny Walker Blue. Dark, deep red mixed with brown is a passionate and rich
                      combination.<br>
                  </p>
                
                <h5>Closing Thoughts </h5>
                <p class="p_blog">Color matching is an important part of men's style. It informs what we choose
                     to say to the world about our style as well as how we want others to see us. Hopefully, by 
                     now you see how easy color matching is. Once you've mastered it, pulling off the perfect outfit
                      will be second nature.<br></p>
