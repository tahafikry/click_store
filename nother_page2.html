        Understanding color and understanding style are synonymous. Colors affect how we perceive things

        I'm sure you are all familiar with the color wheel. Good. That grade school art class information is going 
        to come in handy. If not, shame on your teachers. Either way, here's a refresher.The color wheel is comprised of basic colors. 
        These colors are the basic basis for every color you could imagine. Therefore, understanding these colors first is important. On the wheel, 
        there are primary colors consisting of red, blue, and yellow and secondary colors of green, purple, and orange.<br></p>
                   
        <h6> Associated Colors<br></h6>
                    <p class="p_blog">
                        These are colors directly adjacent from each other on the wheel. Associated colors are important 
                        for monochromatic looks. Think blue jeans and a blue t-shirt or a navy suit and chambray button-up.<br></p>
        <h6> Complementary Colors<br></h6> 
                    <p class="p_blog">
                        These are colors opposite from each other on the wheel. Used together, they make a noticeable contrast. 
                        Complementary colors are for bold, attention-grabbing looks.<br>
                    </p>

                        incorporates multiple colors.<br>
                    </p>


        <h6> Analogous Colors<br></h6>
                    <p class="p_blog">
                        Analogous colors are three colors that reside next to each other and share a dominant color in the middle. 
                        The dominant color is either a primary or secondary color.<br>
